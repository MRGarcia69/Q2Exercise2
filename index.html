        <h2> Momentum </h2>
        Momentum is the result of a particle's mass times its velocity. Momentum possesses both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. The temporal rate of change in momentum is equal to the force applied on the particle, according to Isaac Newton's second law of motion.

        <h2> Impulse </h2>
        In physics, Impulse is a word used to characterize or measure the force that modifies an object's motion over time. It is commonly stated in Newton seconds or kg m/s. It is a vector quantity that may be computed as the product of the force applied and the time over which it acts. It indicates both its magnitude and direction.

        <h2> Valence Electrons </h2>
        According to chemistry and physics, valence electrons are those in an atom's outermost shell that, in the event that the outermost shell is not closed, can take part in the formation of a chemical bond. A shared pair arises in a single covalent bond when each of the bond's two atoms contributes one valence electron.
